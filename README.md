I made this timer as there was no iOS app on the market that precisely satisfied my needs.

## Stories

### Why was I unhappy with the existing timer apps?

- Some were **too simple**, and didn't offer spent-hour tracking (iPhone default Timer),
- Some were **not customisable** (many Pomodoro timers, which can only be set for 25 minutes or 50 minutes for each session)
- And no timer offered **synchronization** with iPhone's default **Apple Calendar** app, which I use to manage my daily schedule.

### So I made a timer which,
- is insanely **simple**,
- can **track** how many hours I spent per category per day,
- can encourage me to **focus**
- can automatically sync with **Apple Calendar**
