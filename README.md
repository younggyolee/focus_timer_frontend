I made this timer as there was no iOS app on the market that precisely satisfied my needs.

### Why was I unhappy with the existing timer apps?

- Some were **too simple**, and didn't offer spent-hour tracking (iPhone default Timer),
- Some were **not customisable** (many Pomodoro timers, which can only be set for 25 minutes or 50 minutes for each session)
- And no timer offered **synchronization** with iPhone's default **Apple Calendar** app, which I use to manage my daily schedule.

### So I made a timer which,
- is insanely **simple**,
- can **track** how many hours I spent per category per day,
- can encourage me to **focus**
- can automatically sync with **Apple Calendar**

### Technical stuffs




<!-- 
As I have been working remotely from home for many months now, time management is essential in my daily life. With the Covid outbreak, there is no more occasional work at cafe, and I literally have to spend 24/7 in my house. There is no boundary between work and private life, and it's very important to track how many hours I put into work.

I have been using a desktop timer app to track my work hours. I usually set 1 hour timer, and also create an event in my Apple Calendar. Then what happens is, in the middle of the 1-hour session, I go downstairs to get some food, and come upstairs, and realise that the timer was still going on. Yes, the timer is on the laptop, and it's not very visually visible, and I forget that there is a timer, and just be away from the desk without pausing. Then I can't track how many minutes actually I put into the task.

But I was still bringing my phone with me most of the time, which means that I am more likely to actually pause a timer on an app when I am away from work, which will help me track the actual work hours. -->
